# arch-installation

### Installation

This script installation is based upon [Anarchy](https://github.com/magnunleno/Anarchy), they did make a huge effort on making this happen, and they deserve all credits. I'am just using this to help with the installation and help port my hardware dependecies into a automatically use.

### WARNING: My .conf file contains specific hardware dependencies.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/snackk/arch-installation
$ ./pre-installation.sh
```
After the reboot you should run:
```sh
$ ./pos-installation.sh
```
Any problem with install just run:
```sh
$ chmod +x pre-installation.sh pos-installation.sh
```
